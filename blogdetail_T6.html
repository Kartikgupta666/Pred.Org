                        our project management processes. There was a lack of streamlined communication, which was

                        decided to take the initiative. I scheduled a meeting with the project management team and
                        proposed the idea of implementing a new project management software that would centralize
                        communication, task tracking, and progress reporting. I believe that this change could greatly
                        improve our efficiency and help us meet our project deadlines more consistently.\<br><br>I
                        assumed the leadership role by outlining a plan for the software implementation. Also,&nbsp; I
                        assigned responsibilities to other interns, set timelines, and provided training to our team
                        members. I encouraged open communication and feedback throughout the process, ensuring that
